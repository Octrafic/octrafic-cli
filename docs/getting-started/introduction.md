# Introduction

## One tool for every API you test

Octrafic is an AI-powered CLI tool for API testing and exploration. It understands your API specifications and generates intelligent tests through natural conversation.

## What Octrafic can help you with

- **Test endpoints naturally** - Describe what you want to test in natural language, and Octrafic generates requests that match your intent, adapting to your API's authentication and structure

- **Explore unfamiliar APIs** - Octrafic can read OpenAPI specs, Markdown docs, or live endpoints to explain how an API works, what parameters it accepts, and what responses to expect

- **Generate test suites** - Octrafic automatically creates comprehensive tests for endpoints, authentication flows, error handling, and data validation based on your API specification

- **Automate repetitive work** - Run routine API checks, regression tests, and monitoring workflows so you can focus on building features instead of manual testing

## How it works

1. Point Octrafic to your API spec or live URL
2. Start an interactive session
3. Chat naturally - ask questions, request tests, explore endpoints
